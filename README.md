# OBS_algorithm_for_Multiplication
 Implementation of LEVEL-4 Overlap free karatsuba Based multiplication Strategy (OBS) Algorithm for polynomial multiplication i.e. Finite field multiplier



In this project, LEVEL-4 Overlap free karatsuba Based multiplication Strategy (OBS) algorithm for polynomial multiplication is synthesized and simulated in Xilinx Vivado 2019.2 using verilog HDL.
